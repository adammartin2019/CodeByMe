                    <p> I am currently a graduate student working as a software engineer with Vexterra Group. I have experience developing software solutions using Python and ArcGIS, but I love learning new development languages and technologies.

                        I enjoy solving challenging problems and am interested in software development and engineering with applications in geospatial analysis, imagery analysis, intelligent and autonomous systems and I have a passion for human space exploration.
                        
                        My Associate's degree is in Physics from Montgomery College and my Bachelor's from University of Maryland is in Geographical Sciences with a specialization in GIS. I will be graduating from the University of Maryland with a Master of Science in Geospatial Information Science in May 2021.
